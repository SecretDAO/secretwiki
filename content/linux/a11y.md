* Prepare your Linux host to work with ledger

Some users may not have their ledger recognized by their Linux host. To fix this issue implement the fix for connection issues on Linux from the [ledger support page](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005165269-Connection-issues-with-Windows-or-Linux)

```bash
wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LedgerHQ/udev-rules/master/add_udev_rules.sh | sudo bash
```
